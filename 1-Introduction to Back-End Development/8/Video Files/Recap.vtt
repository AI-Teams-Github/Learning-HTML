00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.565
such as screen resolutions
and fixed and fluid grids.

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:48.200
You should also be
able to develop

21
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.630

24
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.890
responsive breakpoints and
class modifiers to change

25
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.980
your CSS code and demonstrate
an understanding of

26
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.020
Bootstrap's grid
system by building

27
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.510
a web page using
the Bootstrap grid.

28
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.070
Following your exploration of

29
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.110
UI frameworks and libraries,

30
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.570
you then covered an
introduction to React and

31
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.095
the JavaScript library for
building user interfaces.

32
00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.840
Now that you've completed
an introduction to react,

33
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.209

Explain what a single-page
application is,

38
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.710
how it works, and how it

39
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.125
differs from traditional
web applications.

40
00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.045
You should also be able to

41
00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.345
outline the purpose of React
as a JavaScript library,

42
00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:44.390
explain the concept of the
React component model,

43
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.090
and identify examples
of common components.

44
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.460
Demonstrate a high
level understanding

45
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.960
of React components,

46
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.510
explain how React
components operate as

47
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.800
a hierarchy in order to

48
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.290
generate a web page
through the virtual DOM.

49
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.120
You're now familiar
with the basics

50
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.025
of UI frameworks and libraries,

51
00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.650
and the basics of React
and React Native.

52
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.080
Excellent. You've
made great progress.
