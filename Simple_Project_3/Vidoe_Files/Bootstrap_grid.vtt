00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.361
As you have previously learned building
a website using responsive design requires

2
00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:08.098
a responsive grid and
responsive breakpoints.

3
00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:12.100
Bootstrap provides both of
these as part of its library.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.798
The bootstrap grid system helps us to
create web page layouts through a series

5
00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:19.481
of rows and
columns that house our content.

6
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:24.940
For the grid, bootstrap uses a 12 column
grid system that can be fluid or fixed.

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.340
The bootstrap grid system always
has a container, rows and columns.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.561
The container is the root
element of your grid.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.740
Bootstraps grid system always
starts with the container.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.940
The container contains pads and
aligns your content.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.740
Its width is determined based on
the current responsive breakpoint.

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.840
You can add rows and
inside each row you can add columns.

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.558
Let me demonstrate how we put
this all together by using

14
00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.461
little lemons website as an example.

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.398
All right, I have opened my
joe's burger index.html file.

16
00:00:56.398 --> 00:01:00.340
In this web page I have
added two columns to my row.

17
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.979
Bootstrap is smart and will set the two
columns to span six columns spaces.

18
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.584
If I want to control how many spaces
a column uses, I can suffix a number.

19
00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:12.577
Let's shrink the price
column to four spaces and

20
00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:15.440
expand the menu column to eight spaces.

21
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.540
To do this, I add the suffix-4 to the coal
CSS class above the prices heading.

22
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.040
I also add the suffix-8 to the coal
CSS class above our menu heading.

23
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.440
But here's the amazing part of bootstrap.

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.359
I can configure my content to use
different layouts based on the device

25
00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.340
using the breakpoint specific CSS rules.

26
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.041
Let's have the content stacked on top
of each other on mobile devices and

27
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:43.640
have them display side by
side on desktop devices.

28
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.290
Since columns will wrapped in euros,
if we exceed the 12 column space,

29
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.394
we can use this to stack content.

30
00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:55.099
For mobile devices, I'll set the columns
to use 12 spaces each by adding

31
00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.940
12 as a suffix to the coal rule for
both columns.

32
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.274
Then for desktop I'll set them to six
columns each by using a cold- LG rule and

33
00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:07.840
adding the column sizes-6 as a suffix.

34
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.696
I will save the file by
pressing control and s or

35
00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.561
command s on a Mac and
open it on my web browser.

36
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.840
Notice that now the columns
are side by side.

37
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.763
Next I opened my web developer
tools by pressing the F- 12 key.

38
00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:25.589
In the top left corner,
there is a mobile phone tablet button.

39
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:29.540
Clicking on this button
enables the device mode.

40
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.240
This allows me to simulate
different devices.

41
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.440
I select to view my website on
a mobile phone device, amazing.

42
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.640
My content has stacked
vertically on mobile.

43
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.692
Bootstrap has ensured our website will
work on a mobile phone thanks to its CSS

44
00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:45.640
rules and grid system.

45
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.086
This will save a lot of development
time by not needing to develop different

46
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.340
content layouts per device.

47
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.660
Bootstraps grid system is very powerful
and suitable for most development needs
