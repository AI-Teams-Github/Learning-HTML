00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.740
I'm sure you've created
something from scratch before.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.229
I bet you realize how challenging it
can be as opposed to using pre made

3
00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:07.440
components.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.956
Think about the effort that goes into
building a brand new house versus

5
00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:15.247
the convenience of constructing a modular
building with pre made components that you

6
00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:16.633
just need to put together.

7
00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.887
React is focused on
working with components,

8
00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:23.240
which makes it simple to build functional
user interfaces on web and mobile.

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.118
And, since React is one of the most
popular JavaScript libraries,

10
00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:30.452
it's important that you can
explain what its purposes and

11
00:00:30.452 --> 00:00:33.050
describe how its components work together.

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.606
Available since 2013 React is an open
source library with a community of core

13
00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:40.290
contributors and
companies that maintain it.

14
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.845
Developers use React to develop
single page applications and

15
00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.570
you can also develop mobile
applications with React native.

16
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.100
When you develop an app, you can choose to
use React to develop the user interface.

17
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.040
But building an application
requires more than that.

18
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.146
You must also consider the navigation and

19
00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:00.140
how the app will request
data from a web server.

20
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.173
Therefore React is used in conjunction
with other JavaScript libraries during

21
00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:05.640
development.

22
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.908
But what makes React so

23
00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:11.840
useful is that it allows developers to
write less code to create functionality.

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.497
This in turn makes it easier to
maintain code in the long term and

25
00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:16.810
simplifies testing.

26
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.633
Because it is so
central to front end development,

27
00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.740
there are many tools that
you can use with the React.

28
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.206
These tools can help you understand
how React is running your code and

29
00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:27.951
how you can improve performance.

30
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.265
Now that you have a better idea of what
React is let me tell you more about Reacts

31
00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.040
components.

32
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.627
The key concept behind
React is that it allows you

33
00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:42.340
to define components that you can
combine to build a web application.

34
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.999
A component is basically a small piece of
user interface, such as a music player or

35
00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.440
photo gallery.

36
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.439
This component model allows you to do
several things, such as developing and

37
00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.500
testing parts of their application in
isolation and it also allows you to reuse

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.940
components across multiple sections
of the application as well.

39
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.040
Let's explore an example.

40
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.740
Most Web applications have
user profiles with pictures.

41
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.708
Normally several parts of the application
use a version of this profile picture,

42
00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:13.570
such as in the navigation
bar beside the user's name.

43
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.133
It could also show in a user search result
along with several other user pictures and

44
00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:22.580
the user picture might also display
an instant message notifications.

45
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.518
Instead of programming the logic for

46
00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:28.581
every instance of a user profile picture
React allows you to create a user icon

47
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:33.140
component that displays a version of
a profile picture every time it is used.

48
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.340
You can then reuse this component
throughout the application.

49
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.440
Can you imagine how it will
improve your efficiency.

50
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.288
There are in fact many open source
libraries that provide pre made components

51
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.740
for React projects.

52
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.958
For example, if you want to add
a video player to your website,

53
00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.240
there's a React component library for
that.

54
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.740
Well, maybe you want to embed a map.

55
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.861
There's a React component library for
that too.

56
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.698
As the React community grows bigger,
it continues to add new features and

57
00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:02.840
improvements continuously.

58
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.859
Annual React conferences,
encourage community sharing and

59
00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.840
introduce upcoming
developments in the library.

60
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.896
I hope that in the near future you
might be joining the React community as

61
00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.046
an active member and

62
00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:18.510
as a future React community member you
now know the React libraries purpose and

63
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.540
how its components work together to make
life easier for front end developers.

64
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.167
After all,

65
00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:28.251
why build something from scratch if
the components are already there to use?
